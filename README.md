# Music Controller

In this django and react project we will be using Python and Javascript to create a full stack web app. 
The purpose of this series will be to learn how to use React and Django together to develop a full stack web application. 
Specifically we will be creating a collaborative music playing app in which we will integrate our application with the third party Spotify API.

How to run:

1. Open a new terminal in the working directory of manage.py and run "python manage.py runserver"
2. Open a new terminal in the frontend directory and run "npm run dev"

How to implement updates:

1. If making updates to the frontend, simply apply the updates and refresh the localhost website
2. If making updates to the backend, close the server by hitting CTRL+C, and the type the following:
  "python manage.py makemigrations"
  "python manage.py migrate"
  "python manage.py runserver"
3. Refresh the website to see updates
4. If updates are not visible, do a hard refresh, or an empty cache and hard refresh
